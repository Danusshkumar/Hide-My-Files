# Hide My Files

Hide My Files is an app that hides and encrypts securely your files and keeps your privacy safe. In this app, you can not only hide your files but also encrypt them with some algorithm like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES - this is one of the most secure algorithms when it comes to symmetric key encryption). If you don't want encryption then you can go for the no-encryption mode that will only hide your files without any encryption applied. On opening this app, you will see a calculator layout that is opened by default. You can set the numeric pin to this app there and the next time you open the app, it just looks like an ordinary calculator that does all the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will enter into the app only after you enter the correct password. You can also have an option to reset that pin by answering security questions.

## Features

- Advanced Encryption Standard: We used Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm here so that we will keep your privacy safe. This AES algorithm will come into effect when you select and save "Ultra Secure mode" in "Settings>Encryption modes". By default, the app is set to "Secure encryption" which is a normal type of encryption. If you don't want encryption then you can go for the no-encryption mode that will only hide your files without any encryption applied.
- Storing Secret contacts: This application has the feature of storing contacts so that you can save the contact that you wanted to keep private. You also have an option to call, message, and e-mail the contact you saved via the app. Note that this app itself won't make the call or message.
- Secret diary: This is the sneak peek feature of this app. You can write a diary with this app. The UI part of the diary is so good and you also have an option to add images to your diary entries so that you can write your own history. You can feel the incident you mentioned in the diary by revisiting and reading the diary content. Adding images with a diary will better help you to rewind that memory.
- Camera: You have a camera feature there. With this feature, you can take images or videos that will directly be encrypted and hidden without saving them in the gallery. You can restore them at any time you want.
- Encryption Modes: There are three encryption modes incorporated into this application: no encryption, secure encryption, and ultra secure mode (Advanced Encryption Standard). You can choose what type of encryption you want.
